# DiscordChat

Discord chat is a simple server-side mod that connects Minecraft communication with a Discord server.

## [Example Configuration](https://gist.github.com/shadowfacts/abbae56b1a56018f6fdc)

An example configuration file is seen above. You can copy the example into `config/shadowfacts/DiscordChat.cfg` on your server and then alter the following required values:

  - email: The email of the user you wish to use for connecting to Discord (you can use your own account, normal Discord activity is not affected)
  - password: The password belonging to the account you wish to use for connecting (you can use your own account, normal Discord activity is not affected)
  - channels: A return separated list of channels you want to be relayed to MC and MC chat should be relayed to
  - serverId: The ID number of the Discord server

You can find your Discord server ID in Discord under `Server Settings -> Widget -> Server ID`. [Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/Lq0GL)
